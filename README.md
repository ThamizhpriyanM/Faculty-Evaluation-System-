# Faculty Evaluation System

The Faculty Evaluation System simplifies instructor evaluations by enabling students to give feedback anonymously on teaching clarity, course materials, and engagement. It provides faculty with actionable reports for professional growth, while administrators gain insights for informed decisions on faculty training and course enhancements. This system fosters accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement in academia.
